!!!=== Case-Insensitive Password Pages ===!!!
Author: Nuno Batista
Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 4.0.0
Latest Version: 1.0

This plugin does the simple task of making the form of the Password protected page case-insensitive.
Please keep in mind that no change is done inside the Wordpress admin, which means that if you insert a capital letter as password, the verification will not work.

Ex:

1- Password Protected Page in the admin: Password
2. Password Inserted by user in the frontend: Password

This will fail because the result of the step 2 is "password" due to the constant lowercase.

After you install this plugin you need to have always lowercase passwords setup in your admin.

== HOW TO INSTALL ==

1. Create a folder inside the Plugins called "case-insensitive-pages";
2. Upload the file "wp-case-insensitive-password-pages.php";
3. Activate the Plugin inside Wordpress.
